# Description
The E-Commerce Back End program is a Node.js server-side application that runs a MySql database that contains product and inventory data for an e-commerce website. It also uses the Sequelize ORM to communicate with the database, and Express package to run routes. Since the program is entirely back-end, it's helpful to use an API tool such as Postman to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE calls to view and manipulate the database. A video in my google drive of how it works is linker below.
